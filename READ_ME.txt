Purpose: Making purchase requests for McMaster was getting tedious with the copipasta and formatting for markup
    so that it was easy to use seemed like a logical next step.

Workflow:
    1. Make your McMaster cart like you normally would.
    2. Email the McM cart to an Outlook account you have access to.
    3. Save/Drag the message (*.msg format) to a location on your machine where you can find it.
        I would use your desktop.
    4. Run the executable and find your file.
    5. Once you select your file and open it, the program will automagically copy the correct info from the
        file to your clipboard.
    6. Create a new purchase card in trello.
    7. Paste the copied data to your new trello card and save the card.
    8. Wait with anticipation for your parts to arrive.
    9. Rinse and repeat.
